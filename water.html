                In a developed nation such as the US, access to water is not only assumed to be immediately available but
                also assumed to be safe. In this context, safe means there’s an extremely low chance of contracting
                an illness as a direct result drinking the water supply. In many of the poorest parts of the world,
                water borne diseases and water contamination is a real threat and a constant drag on quality of life.
                This is the <span class="med-text">Global Water Crisis</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Access to clean water is foundational: when this basic need is not met consistently, it averts
                time and effort away from other community-building activities. When it is no longer a primary
                issue, people are able to improve their hygiene and sanitation. Children are able to attend school
                without other duties demanding their attention, and adults can tend to crops and livestock or start
                businesses. But it all comes out of a bedrock of local, consistent access to clean water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though this certainly is a global problem (it’s in the name, after all), the efforts of Team
                World Vision are focused on a subset of African countries of greatest need, and so this
                publication will primarily present data on the African continent.

                The group most directly affected by the Global Water Crisis are women and children. Strictly considering health,
                children are most vulnerable to disease which may be lurking in unsanitary water such as cholera or
                typhoid, leading to extended time away from school or (not too uncommonly) death. Disproportionately,
                women and girls are tasked with the physical collection of clean water from the nearest source, which
                can be many kilometers away. It’s estimated that African women and girls collectively spend
                <span class="med-text">200 million hours</span> each day in collection, half of which involved
                hauling a jerrycan which can weigh up to 18 kilograms.

            <p class="large-first-letter">Efforts to address the Global Water Crisis in the past couple
            decades have started to improve clean water access on the African continent. Data from UNICEF, a United
                Nations relief organization,
            shows that since 2000 the impact of the crises has been improving markedly in some areas, while maintaining
            a grip on other area, primarily those whose population is less urban. Urban areas are more likely to
            not only have clean water systems, but system within a reasonable distance from a community. Rural areas
            may have systems available, but they are either off-site locally (within a 30 minute walk round trip) or
            not available locally (more than a 30 minutes walk round trip). In extreme cases, no water system is
            available to a community within any reasonable distance, so it must rely on surface water which may be
            contaminated by animal feces.</p>
            <p>
                Even as of 2015, some countries still have an alarmingly low percentage of residents with immediate
                access to clean water, considered basic service. It's these countries where World Vision tends to
                concentrate its efforts to bring accessible clean water to communities.
